Woah first big Odin Project Activity 

Start: Thsi is my second time trying this. I know that it's gonna be like this for a loong time. A lot of failures, a lot of difficult times, and a LOT of practice. I just hope that I can continue doing this with the people I love, my friends, so that in the end I can create something that I am genuinely proud of while still making money. I know it sounds like an outlandish and impossible dream, but if I don't believe in it then it's already lost. At least this way, there's a chance. I'm willing to take that chance. 

End:

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The best corned beef in the world. It's not my intention to boast, but I spent years of my life 
        perfecting this recipe to ensure that it was the <strong>PERFECT</strong> recipe. Nothing beats this.
    </p>
    <p> 
        All the ingredients to be used for this recipe have to be fresh. By fresh, I mean literally taken within
        the day. For example, the oil has to be extracted from your in home farm (which I assume you have, as all
        good cooks and bakers do). The recipe will also call for a "frying" portion in which I require you to use
        purple fire specifically or you won't get the intended results (trust). At the end, you'll have the perfect
        serving of corned beef, enough to make Gordon Ramsey himself implode and then come back to life then explode,
        repeating an endless cycle of ecstacy and pain simply because of how mouth-wateringly delicious this
        recipe is. Good luck!
